# Login Form
This is a test login form to see how it would work on an actual website. It does not store any of the information entered but that being said please do not enter in any personal information. The fields all check that information has been entered before the create account button is clicked otherwise a warning message is displayed.

The login button currently loops back to the same page since this is only a test page but ideally it would redirect to an actual login page in an application.
